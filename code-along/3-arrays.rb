# # Arrays are lists of things

# #favorite_foods = ["Pizza", "Burger", "Alu Bhorta"]
# # puts favorite_foods

# # number_set = [4,8,15,16,23,42]
# # puts number_set



# # Accessing the array
favorite_foods = ["Pizza", "Burger", "Alu Bhorta"]
# #puts favorite_foods[-3]

# # Add to the array

# favorite_foods << "Tacos"
# puts favorite_foods

favorite_foods.push("Daal")
puts favorite_foods
favorite_foods.pop
